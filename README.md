# Lung-Image-Classifier
The project involves image classification using three convolutional neural network (CNN) models: a Custom CNN, DenseNet, and GoogLeNet. The dataset comprises grayscale images with dimensions (232, 232, 1), and the goal is to evaluate the performance of these models in categorizing images into three distinct classes(COVID, NORMAL, PNEUMONIA).
